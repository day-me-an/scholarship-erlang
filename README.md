# scholarship-erlang

This is the first non-trivial program I've written in a ~~purely~~ primarily functional language. It took about an afternoon.

To learn Erlang I decided to try and port an old program I wrote that won a prize a few years ago.

Currently it doesn't use any of Erlang's concurrency features, but I plan to make it fully distributed as a side project to learn Erlang.
